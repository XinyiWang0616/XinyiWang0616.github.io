I enjoy knitting, especially sewing clothes for dolls, which somewhat fulfills my dream of becoming a fashion designer. Painting and exercising also provide relaxation in my busy life. Additionally, visiting art galleries is one of my favorite activities.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/bear.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rabbit.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/bad1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/bad2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

I really enjoy running and badminton. I love all things beautiful, including delicious food, scenic views, and art!
