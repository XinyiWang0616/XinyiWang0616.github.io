  title={Effects of Coastal Urbanization on Habitat Quality: A Case Study in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area},
  author={Wang, Xinyi and Su, Fenzhen and Yan, Fengqin and Zhang, Xinjia and Wang, Xuege},
  abstract={Coastal areas are usually considered as pioneering areas for economic development and reform due to their unique geographical locations and ecological conditions. Correspondingly, rapid urbanization in coastal urban agglomerations has resulted in population concentration and land use/cover change (LUCC), leading to the decline of habitat quality and biodiversity. However, few studies have quantitatively explored the impacts of urban agglomeration expansion in coastal zones on habitat quality. Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao-Great Bay Area (GBA) as a case study, we applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model to assess the habitat quality based on land use data obtained from remote sensing images from 1980 to 2020 and developed a geographically weighted regression model to quantitatively analyze the response of habitat quality to urbanization. The results showed that (1) LUCC in the GBA was dramatic from 1980 to 2020, dominated by the shift from various land use types to construction land, which led to increased fragmentation; (2) the overall habitat quality showed a decreasing trend, characterized by low values in the central part and high values in the surrounding area; (3) population and construction land such urbanization elements had a more significantly negative effect on habitat quality changes, while the relationships among slope, road distance, and habitat quality changes were complex. Based on above analysis, this paper suggests that future land management in the GBA should develop in the direction of intensification, refinement, and regional integration.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
