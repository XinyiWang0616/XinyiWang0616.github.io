  title={Adaptive Integrated Coastal Zone Planning: History, Challenges, Advances, and Perspectives},
  author={Wang, Xinyi and Su, Fenzhen and Wang, Xuege and Pan, Tingting and Cui, Yikun and Vincent, Lyne and Yan*, Fengqin},
  abstract={Coastal zones are dynamic, rich environments, now densely populated, and increasingly challenged by human and climate-change pressures. Effective long-term integrated coastal zone planning is needed to ensure sustainable environmental protection and economic development. In this study, we reviewed the history of coastal zone planning since its birth in the 1950s based on the literature retrieved from the Web of Science (Core Collection) from 2000â€“2023, then summarized the tools and spatial allocation methods commonly used in the planning process, and finally proposed potential solutions to the challenges faced. The results show that after decades of development, coastal zone planning has changed from a decentralized activity to a targeted and integrated one, with an increasing emphasis on the ecosystem approach and the use of multiple planning tools. Spatial analysis techniques and environmental modelling software have become increasingly popular. Linear programming and overlay analysis are common approaches when performing spatial optimization, but land-sea interactions and planning in the marine parts still lack in-depth analysis and practical experience. We are also aware that the challenges posed by the integration of administrative hierarchies, scoping and conservation objectives, stakeholder participation, consideration of social dimensions, and climate change are pervasive throughout the planning process. There is an urgent need to develop more flexible and accurate spatial modelling tools, as well as more efficient participatory methods, and to focus on the holistic nature of the land-sea system to create more resilient and sustainable coastal zones.},

  title={Effects of Coastal Urbanization on Habitat Quality: A Case Study in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area},
  author={Wang, Xinyi and Su, Fenzhen and Yan*, Fengqin and Zhang, Xinjia and Wang, Xuege},
  abstract={Coastal areas are usually considered as pioneering areas for economic development and reform due to their unique geographical locations and ecological conditions. Correspondingly, rapid urbanization in coastal urban agglomerations has resulted in population concentration and land use/cover change (LUCC), leading to the decline of habitat quality and biodiversity. However, few studies have quantitatively explored the impacts of urban agglomeration expansion in coastal zones on habitat quality. Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao-Great Bay Area (GBA) as a case study, we applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model to assess the habitat quality based on land use data obtained from remote sensing images from 1980 to 2020 and developed a geographically weighted regression model to quantitatively analyze the response of habitat quality to urbanization. The results showed that (1) LUCC in the GBA was dramatic from 1980 to 2020, dominated by the shift from various land use types to construction land, which led to increased fragmentation; (2) the overall habitat quality showed a decreasing trend, characterized by low values in the central part and high values in the surrounding area; (3) population and construction land such urbanization elements had a more significantly negative effect on habitat quality changes, while the relationships among slope, road distance, and habitat quality changes were complex. Based on above analysis, this paper suggests that future land management in the GBA should develop in the direction of intensification, refinement, and regional integration.},
