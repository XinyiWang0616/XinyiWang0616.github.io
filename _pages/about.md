Hi! I am `Xinyi Wang`(王欣宜), a Master student supervised by Prof. [Fenzhen Su](http://english.igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/yw_30508/scientists/En_sklreis/202012/t20201211_456388.html) and Assoc Prof. [Fengqin Yan](http://english.igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/yw_30508/fyjy/En_sklreis/202310/t20231031_448464.html) at State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System (LREIS), Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). My research interests include ecological remote sensing analysis and data assimilation, modeling of carbon and water fluxes and changing landscape.

I am passionate about using `multi-source data` and `artificial intelligence` to carry out ecological remote sensing monitoring and analyze how human activities and natural variability affect ecosystems, improving understanding of vegetation photosynthesis and climate change.
