Hi! I am `Xinyi Wang`(王欣宜), a Master student supervised by Prof. [Fenzhen Su](http://english.igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/yw_30508/scientists/En_sklreis/202012/t20201211_456388.html) and Assoc Prof. [Fengqin Yan](http://english.igsnrr.cas.cn/sourcedb/yw_30508/fyjy/En_sklreis/202310/t20231031_448464.html) at State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System (LREIS), Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). My research interests include ecological remote sensing, interactions of air-water-ecosystem, and ecosystem resilience analysis.

I would like to integrate remote sensing, process-based models, and field observations to study the linkages between ecosystem productivity and water fluxes and their responses to climate change.

My research includes: 1) designing machine learning approaches to generate novel datasets; 2) utilizing ecological models to understand the mechanisms of energy and atmospheric cycling; 3) conducting spatiotemporal data analysis to interpret ecosystem responses on natural and management factors.
